# Project-2-Coffee-Shop-Sales-Insights-
##ðŸ“„ Project Overview
###1. Abstract
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a coffee shopâ€™s 2023 transactional data. It aims to uncover key business insights by analyzing product performance, sales trends, and customer behavior. The dataset includes information like transaction time, location, product type, pricing, and quantity. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization, we identify top-selling products, peak hours, and store-wise performance to support business decisions.
